        <p>
            GlobalMeet Webcast is a live video streaming platform for enterprise companies. I worked on a vision-oriented redesign for this web app by creating all new UI, navigation and page structures, as well as flows for event creation, event delivery, recording, chat and analytics. I also turned all that into a high-fidelity prototype for user testing and a promotional video.

        <h3>🗺 Discovery</h3>
        <p>We started the project by gathering stakeholders form product, development, marketing and customer care for a discovery workshop. What does the product do? Who does it serve? How is it different? Why is it valuable?</p>

        <h3>🧐 Product Audit</h3>
        <p>Each part of the platform was surveyed and the architecture was recreated in flow charts and maps, noting pain-points and inconsistencies. The importance of flows like event creation began to emerge.</p>

        <h3>👨🏻‍💻 Interviews and Surveys</h3>
        <p>Interviews were conducted with existing customers, with a focus on the positive and negative experiences for participants, admins and presenters.</p>

        <h3>🎾 Competitor Review</h3>
        <p>We looked at the onboarding, event creation and hosting flows of our top competitors and built a folder of screenshots and recordings, noting things that worked and opportunities to differentiate. </p>

        <h3> 🧑‍🍳 Personas</h3>
        <p>We started with five market verticals and expanded each into three webcast user types: organizer, presenter and attendee.</p>

        <p>Beginning with the Corporate Communication vertical, we imagined roles, typical work days, pain points, goals and important webcast features for each persona.</p>

        <h3>❤️ Empathy Mapping</h3>
        <p>Next we focused on Carla, a Communications Manager and webcast organizer. Plotting her journey from onboarding to post-event, we described what she might be doing, feeling, and thinking along the way.</p>

        <h3>🌊 Flows</h3>
        <p>With the existing product mapped, we started to reorganize and simplify the most important user flows, processes and structures. </p>

        <h3>🏗️ UI Structure</h3>
        <p>At the lowest-fidelity level we considered various navigation structures. This foundation would need to support all stages and environments. It had to be simple and intuitive, but also scale to accommodate advanced features and settings. </p>

        <h3>💠 Design System</h3>
        <p>I expanded the GlobalMeet design system for this platform, cross-referencing with Material. Each part of the UI was built with repeatable, pattern-based components and variants. </p>

        <h3>🖼 UI </h3>
        <p>Using the components, I created mocks in Figma for key environments and flows: event admin, advanced settings, event studio, analytics and attendee player. </p>

        <h3>▶️ Prototype</h3>
        <p>I took the designs to the next level with a high-fidelity prototype (made in ProtoPie), adding animations, transitions, interaction states, dynamic forms and simulated webcam feeds. </p>
